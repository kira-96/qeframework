/* Description:
 *
 * This class provides a communication mechanism from the code creating QE widgets
 * to the QE widgets.
 *
 * When QE widgets, such as QELabel, are created, they need to know environmental
 * information such as what macro substitutions to apply, or where to signal error
 * messages. Also, the code creating the QE widgets may require a reference to all
 * the created QE widgets. In some cases this information cannot be passed during 
 * construction or set up post construction via a method. For example, when the 
 * object is being created from a UI file by Qt. In this case the application code 
 * asks Qt to generate objects from a UI file and has no idea what QE widgets if
 * any have been created.
 *
 * To use this class, an instance of this class is instantiated prior to creating
 * the QE widgets. Information to be communicated such as message handlers and 
 * macro substitutions is set up within this class. Then the QE widgets are created
 * using a mechanism such as the QUiLoader class.
 *
 * As each QE widgets is created it also instantiates an instance of the ContainerProfile
 * class. If any information has been provided, it can then be used.
 *
 * Note, a local copy of the environment profile is saved per instance, so an
 * application creating QE widgets (the container) can define a profile, create
 * QE widgets, then release the profile.
 *
 * To use this class
 *         - Instantiate a ContainerProfile class
 *         - Call setupProfile()
 *         - Create QE widgets
 *         - Call releaseProfile()
 *
 * This class also communicates the current user level between the application
 * and contained widgets. This differs from other environmental information 
 * described above in the following ways:
 *
 * - Widgets based on the QEWidget class (and therefore this ContainerProfile 
 *   class) can be notified of user level changes by reimplementing 
 *   QEWidget::userLevelChanged()
 *   Note, Widgets can also determine the current user level by calling
 *   ContainerProfile::getUserLevel()
 *
 * - Both the application and any widgets based on the QEWidget class can set
 *   the user level by calling ContainerProfile::setUserLevel().
 *   For example, the QELogin widgt can alter the user level from within a GUI,
 *   alternatively the application can manage the user level.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - If an application creates the ContainerProfile class early, before the 
 *   widgets that are published in the profile, or if the published widgets
 *   change the widgets in the profile can be updated by calling updateConsumers().
 *   Alternatively, just the widget that launches new GUIs can be updated
 *   with replaceGuiLaunchConsumer().
 *
 * - An application may need to temprarily extend the the macro substitutions.
 *   For example, when creating an QEForm widget as a sub form within another 
 *   QEForm widget. Macro substitutions can be extended by calling
 *   addMacroSubstitutions() then restored using removeMacroSubstitutions().
